# WP Engine Self Serve Scoping Tool

---

***NOTE: THIS IS FOR INTERNAL USE ONLY***

This easy to use executable tool will allow you to self serve scoping up to a P3 for existing customer upgrades and downgrades. SE assistance is required thereafter. 

Start by opening the `install.sh` file by right clicking or (Control + Click) it to install dependencies and instructions on use. If you cannot see `Terminal` or `Terminal.app` as an option, then select *Other...* > *All Applications* under the *Enable:* dropdown menu > Double-click the `Terminal` App Icon.

After install, to execute, you should be able to double click the `WP Engine Autoscope Tool.app` Application (in your Application folder), which should open in iTerm2 by default. If any warnings come up you can ignore them, or choose to permanently suppress them. Follow ALL instructions carefully from there.

Outside of this ***you will require WP Engine Overdrive Access, WP Engine VPN access, and the ability to impersonate customers***. You should be impersonating the specific customer account you wish to scope ***prior*** to executing this. This is also provided as instructions when opening the executable.
