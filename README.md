# WP Engine Self Serve Scoping Tool

---

***NOTE: THIS IS FOR INTERNAL USE ONLY***

This easy to use executable tool will allow you to self serve scoping up to a P3 for existing customer upgrades and downgrades. SE assistance is required thereafter. 

Start by opening the `install.sh` file by right clicking or (Ctrl + Click) it to install dependencies and instructions on use.

After install, to execute, you should be able to double click the `autoscope.sh` file, which should open in iTerm2 by default. Follow ALL instructions carefully from there.

Screenshots demonstrating installation and creating an alias for easy use are included.

Outside of this ***you will require WP Engine Overdrive Access, WP Engine VPN access, and the ability to impersonate customers***. You should be impersonating the specific customer account you wish to scope ***prior*** to executing this. This is also provided as instructions in the `autoscope.sh` executable.
